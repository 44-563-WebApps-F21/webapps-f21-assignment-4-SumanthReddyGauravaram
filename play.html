    <h1>Produced by Sumanth Kumar Reddy Gauravaram</h1>

    <h3 class = "name">An Ideal Husband A Play</h3>
    <h5 class="name">Fourth Act : _Same as Act II_(_Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_)</h5>
<p class="stage-direction">[LORD GORING _is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]</p>

<h6 class="LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h6>  <p class="speech">[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
bell_.]  It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
latest edition of something or other.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter servant_.]</p>

<h6 class="JAMES">JAMES</h6>  <p class="speech">Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>

<h6 class="LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h6>  <p class="speech">Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>

<h6 class="JAMES">JAMES</h6>  <p class="speech">Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
come in from riding.</p>

<h6 class="LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h6>  <p class="speech">[_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.</p>

<h6 class="JAMES">JAMES</h6> <p class="speech">Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p>

<h6 class="LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech"> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>

<h6 class="JAMES">JAMES</h6> <p class="speech"> [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Exit servant_.]</p>

<h6 class="LORD-GORING">LORD GORING</h6> <p class="speech">Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
begins to read it_.]</p>

<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>

<h6 class="LORD-CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</h6> <p class="speech"> Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?</p>
